# Entity Framework Core Demo

This repo contains demo applications that I was showing at [DotNext 2017 in St. Petersburg](http://www.dotnext-piter.ru/en).


## Slides

[Entity Framework Core: Is It Ready Yet?](slides.pdf)

## Prerequisities

Since .NET Core 2.0 tooling is not final, you need to install the [Visual Studio 2017 Preview](https://www.visualstudio.com/cs/vs/preview/).

The demo uses *Entity Framework Core 2.0.0-preview1*. 

The UI is made using [DotVVM](https://github.com/riganti/dotvvm), a framework which protects web developers from writing too much JavaScript.
